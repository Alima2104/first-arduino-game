# Memory-game
Description: 
It is a memory game on Arduino Uno. The game starts with three flashing LEDs. To start the sequence, user should turn on red LED with potentiometer (analog input). Then, the random LED starts to light up, and the player must press the button of the same color within 2.5 seconds after it goes out. Then another LED lights up, and so their number increases. If the player messes up the order or does not have time for 2.5 seconds, the game ends, the LEDs light up again until the game starts again automatically.
